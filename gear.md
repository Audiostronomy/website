This is the future home of a page dedicated to the gear (hardware and software) used to transmutate astronomy data into music and sounds.

## Software

The general workflow is to load astronomy data, perform a conversion of data values (e.g., brightness) into note pitch and determine a spacing between the notes.
The latter can be constant in time, or depend on the data, if the data have a relation to time.
These note sequences are then sent via [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) to a syntheizer and the resulting sounds are recorded.

Typically, these scripts are programmed in [python](https://www.python.org), and all are available on the [audiostronomy github page](https://github.com/Audiostronomy).
